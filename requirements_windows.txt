# ============================================================================
# INSTALLATION NOTES FOR WINDOWS
# ============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: Install in this order to avoid issues!
#
# 1. Install Visual C++ Build Tools (for dlib):
#    Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
#    Select: "Desktop development with C++"
#
# 2. Install CMake (for dlib):
#    Download: https://cmake.org/download/
#    Add to PATH during installation
#
# 3. Create virtual environment:
#    python -m venv venv
#    venv\Scripts\activate
#
# 4. Upgrade pip:
#    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
#
# 5. Install dlib (CRITICAL - use pre-built wheel for easier installation):
#    # For Python 3.10 64-bit:
#    pip install https://github.com/jloh02/dlib/releases/download/v19.22/dlib-19.22.99-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
#
#    # Or try pip (may fail without build tools):
#    pip install dlib
#
# 6. Install all other packages:
#    pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
#
# ALTERNATIVE: Use Conda (EASIER):
#    conda create -n attendance python=3.10
#    conda activate attendance
#    conda install -c conda-forge dlib
#    pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
#    - If numpy 2.x causes issues: pip install "numpy>=1.21.0,<2.0.0"
#    - If dlib fails: Use conda or pre-built wheel
#    - If TensorFlow is too large: Use tensorflow-cpu
#
