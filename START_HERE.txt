TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

1. ENROLL WITH GOOD LIGHTING
   - Best: Natural daylight or bright room lighting
   - Avoid: Backlighting, shadows, dim rooms

2. ENROLL MULTIPLE ANGLES
   - Capture face looking slightly left, center, right
   - This improves recognition accuracy

3. CONSISTENT APPEARANCE
   - If person usually wears glasses, enroll with glasses
   - If appearance changes significantly, re-enroll

4. POSITIONING
   - Keep face 1-3 feet from camera
   - Center face in camera view
   - Ensure full face is visible

5. EMOTION DETECTION
   - Works best with clear, well-lit faces
   - Shows: happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral, disgust
   - Takes 3 seconds after recognition to analyze
